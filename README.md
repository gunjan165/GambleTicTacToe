# GambleTicTacToe

A twist to the basic tic tac toe game.
Each player starts with 100 coins and both players bet certain coins anonymously in a bid to have a right to mark the board.
The player with the higher bid gets the chance to place a mark on the board.
If both the players bid the same amount then the amount is refunded otherwise both the winner and loser lose the coins that they have bid.
Usual tic tac toe rules decide the winner of the game.
If a decision is not reached by the usual rules then 
If a player reaches to 0 coins then he loses.
The player with higher coins wins.
